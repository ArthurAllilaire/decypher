# Decypher
This is a library with several useful functions to help with the national cipher challenges and beyond.

I have written a series of articles on building this library. With the ultimate aim of creating a single deciphering function that takes a text and returns the decrypted text, no extra information needed.

Currently the library can decipher caeser and affine shifts very efficiently through frequency analysis of the text.
